            <h2>How to Participate in Sessions</h2>
            All sessions are delivered using Microsoft Teams meetings.  All attendees will join the meeting muted.  We encourage you to use Microsoft Teams Emotes throughout the sessions and to use meeting chat to communicate with speakers and other attendees.  Speakers and Event Organizers may allow you to UNMUTE your audio to ask questions as needed.
